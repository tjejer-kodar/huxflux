This is my solution to the February 2021 code challenge: HuxFlux Function. The challenge is arranged by tjejerkodar.se in collaboration with svenskaspel.se.

For this challenge I didnÂ´t changed anything in the user interface, I did the logic only, so my code contribution is in huxflux.js.

My function will fill an array with 7 random and unique integers between 1 and 35, and have a method to control that a number never is repeated.
